                <ul>
                    <li>Are you threatened with eviction?</li>

        <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
            <p>Under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, a person can discharge much of their debt, including credit card debt, medical bills, and personal loans.  People going through Chapter 7 are often able to keep their home and their vehicle. 
                As a general rule, a debtor can keep most, if not all, of his or her personal property under Ohio exemptions.</p>
                <br>
            <p>One of the wonderful things about filing a bankruptcy petition is that the debtor gets immediate relief. 
                Everything stops, including evictions, utility shut offs, wage garnishments, foreclosures, the seizure of cars or other personal property, and the endless parade of harassing creditor phone calls and letters.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Assuming no complications, a debtor can generally get his or her discharge in 3 to 4 months.  It is quick and life changing.</p>
                <br>
            <p>One of the common mistakes made by debtors is that they do not file for bankruptcy soon enough.</p>
